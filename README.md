## The catalyst/ Directory

`catalyst/` is this repository's Catalyst rule set — the documents an agent reads before it changes anything here, adopted into this repository from the Catalyst template. They are contracts, not descriptions: `catalyst/prime-directive.md` says how work runs (task weights, the feature and decision gates, branch and commit discipline), `catalyst/architecture.md` says what this system may be built from, and `catalyst/project-summary.md` indexes this project's own features and decisions. Start at `catalyst/AGENTS.md` — it is the file index, and everything else loads on demand.

The project's own documents are written inside the bundle (`catalyst/features/`, `catalyst/decisions/`), never in root-level directories. The rule set is upgraded in place from the Catalyst repository, so `catalyst/` is edited deliberately and never reorganized.
